    text: `I would have loved to buy you thousands of flowers and a million boxes of chocolates and take you to the fanciest of restaurants for dinner on this special day, unfortunately, I can't. What I CAN do is remind you of how special you are to me.

The attachment below has 3 files in it, divided into: I, Love and You.
I - It's a personal message I wrote for you
Love - They say music is the language of love and I tried to show that by making a playlist with the songs that feel most special to me.
You - A short video I put together hopefully showing how I see You as a person. (P.S I'm not a very good video editor ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­).

Happy Valentine's day my love. I love you more than words can describe. Keep being special to me.
Sending you lots of Love on this special day Eriife! ðŸ’–
