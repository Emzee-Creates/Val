# My first attempt at creating a valentine's website.
Its a simple website with a pink gradient background, some text and a button. When the button is clicked, balloons float up the screen which can be popped by clicking on them and a mail is sent to a specified email address. The code itself is pretty self explanatory.

The site was built with HTML and Node.Js
